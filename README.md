# Redflameken's NeoDotfiles

This will now be my main dotfiles repo that includes all of my setups (Hyprland, i3, sway)

To install the dotfiles, I have made an install script (currently very new and needs many improvements:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedFlameKen2/neodotfiles/master/.scripts/installScript.sh
chmod +x installScript.sh
./installScript.sh
```
Afterwards, just wait for pacman and yay to do their thing and BOOM, we have the system now! <br>
