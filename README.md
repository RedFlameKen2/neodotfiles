# Redflameken's NeoDotfiles

This will now be my main dotfiles repo that includes all of my setups (Hyprland, i3, sway)

To install the dotfiles, I have made an install script (currently very new and needs many improvements:
```
mkdir $HOME/git
git clone https://github.com/redflameken2/neodotfiles $HOME/git/neodotfiles
chmod +x $HOME/git/neodotfiles/installScript.sh
$HOME/git/neodotfiles/installScript.sh
```
Afterwards, just wait for pacman and yay to do their thing and BOOM, you have a copy of my system now! <br>
